Laravel Migration Error: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes
解决：
1.
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function boot()
{
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
}

2.
I don't know why the above solution and the official solution which is adding

Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
in AppServiceProvider didn't work for me. What worked for was editing the database.php file in config folder. Just edit

'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
'collation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
to

'charset' => 'utf8',
'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
